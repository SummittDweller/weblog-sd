&lt;p>This morning &lt;a href="https://www.geocaching.com/p/default.aspx?guid=77b132a8-363f-4989-97d0-8e44db236ada&amp;amp;wid=caae59c7-5c17-43b9-a980-98d6c1a7d7da&amp;amp;ds=2">The FLC Committee&lt;/a>, aka Borky00, aka Bill, asked me about possible outdoor park settings for FLC as a means of giving folks plenty of room for social distancing. Bill mentioned a couple of possibilities including a Tama city park on east 4th Street, and the Lincoln Highway Bridge park at the intersection of 5th Street and old US Highway 30.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The city park on east 4th Street is a no-go. There&amp;rsquo;s never been much in the way of facilities there, and after the storm there is literally nothing there. I did have three other possibilities in mind, and needed to check up on them after the storm anyway, so I took a few minutes this morning to gather some information.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lincoln-highway-bridge-park---east-5th-street-in-tama">Lincoln Highway Bridge Park - East 5th Street in Tama&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This little park, and I do mean little, features two very small shelters but NO grills for cooking. It&amp;rsquo;s a small outdoor meeting place near Tama&amp;rsquo;s iconic Lincoln Highway Bridge, and home to a couple of my own geocache hides. Here&amp;rsquo;s what it looks like after the storm.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is Tama&amp;rsquo; primary park and I&amp;rsquo;d heard it was cleaned up right after the storm, but there&amp;rsquo;s still LOTs of damage here and lots more cleanup to be done. Also, there&amp;rsquo;s only a fireplace in the small shelter, and no grills left on the grounds, at least none that I could see.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I think this is probably our best bet, assuming the City of Toledo can get the major debris taken care of before the FLC event. I&amp;rsquo;ll call the city later today to see just how likely that might be.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This park, about 1/2-mile west of the restaurant that FLC previously booked, has one nice large open shelter with a fireplace, AND two large grills just north of the shelter. Have a look.&lt;/p>

So I pitched in during the morning at the home of my &amp;ldquo;scurry&amp;rdquo; partners Jeff and Mary Fasse-Shaw, to help with cutting up some of the deadfall along the creek on the west side of their property. We got a good start, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of fallen timber to be cleared there!&lt;/p></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/2020-derecho-follow-up-august-23/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/2020-derecho-follow-up-august-23/</guid><description>&lt;p>Almost every day for the past few months I have walked with my &amp;ldquo;scurry&amp;rdquo; around Cherry Lake in Tama. We generally walk in the morning before the heat, humidity, and mosquitoes get too bad. We finally got power back on Thursday evening, August 20, so on Friday morning, August 21, 2020, we walked for the first time since the derecho of August 10. It was actually more like an obstacle course than our usual stroll, but we still managed to collect quite a bit of trash, as usual. There were about a dozen places around the lake, a trail that is about 1.33 miles long, where fallen trees required that we climb over or weave around. It&amp;rsquo;s no fun to do either, especially since the &amp;ldquo;weaving&amp;rdquo; sometimes involved venturing off-trail into the poison ivy. Makes me itch just thinking about it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the west end of Cherry Lake I placed a bench and engraved rock as a memorial for my parents, and my son, Ian. The most recent, pre-derecho photo of the rock and bench was taken on a &amp;ldquo;scurry&amp;rdquo; walk around the lake early this Spring. Portions of scurry-partners Jeff Shaw, and the hind-quarters of four-legged scurry member, Titan Edward, can be seen in this photo from that excursion.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>McFate Memorial Bench at Cherry Lake - Early Spring 2020&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the south side of the lake &amp;ndash; visible in the background of the photo above &amp;ndash; the trail runs parallel to a road that leads to a brush pile where Tama residents can dump tree limbs, brush and leaves collected from their yard. There&amp;rsquo;s been a LOT of that lately! On this occasion a friend of our, Charlie Betz, was hauling a pickup-load of derecho debris to the brush pile and stopped briefly to chat. Charlie suggested that someday soon he would return with his chainsaw to begin clearing deadfall from the trail. We told him to let us know when, and we&amp;rsquo;d see if we could come help. Well, that &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; was 7 AM the next day, Saturday, August 22.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I arrived at the lake at 7 AM on the 22nd and found Charlie already there, preparing to fire up his saw. I brought my little 10&amp;rdquo; Ryobi cordless electric chainsaw and two fully-charged batteries. Jeff Shaw arrived about 20 minutes later and we proceeded to work our way counter-clockwise around the lake trail startring from the parking area on the east end of the lake. It was slow going, especially at first since the north side of the lake is, or was, densely wooded with some mature trees.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After three hours of cutting and tossing debris to the side of the trail, we reached my family&amp;rsquo;s memorial bench at the west end of the lake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>McFate Memorial Bench at Cherry Lake - After the Derecho&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By this time we had waded through way too much PI, been briefly rained on, dulled Charlie&amp;rsquo;s chainsaw blade, and drained both of the saw batteries I had on hand. I think we were drained too. Time for a break, so at 10 AM we departed for some rest, lunch, fresh batteries, and hopefully a new chain for Charlie&amp;rsquo;s saw. We reconvened at Noon, as planned, and spent the next two hours clearing the deadfall around the McFate bench, plus a pair of gnarly monsters that had fallen across the trail near the southeast corner of the lake.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It felt really good to get it all done, and now we can engage in our &amp;ldquo;scurry&amp;rdquo; walks around the lake without all the bobbing and weaving required to navigate the obstacle course that was. Every good volunteer effort should conclude with a photo or two, so we got all cleaned up, NOT, and I shot this one.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a warp.

Perhaps in the morning I&amp;rsquo;ll stretch our broken power line across the street and pitch a tent next door until an Alliant truck stops and gets this done. I know they are busy, but 15 minutes of one lineman&amp;rsquo;s time a week ago, when it was first &amp;ldquo;promised&amp;rdquo;, would have been so nice. I fixed my own Mediacom connection more than a week ago, and there&amp;rsquo;s evidence tonight that their service has been restored. So, if I had power, I think we would also have TV and internet. IF.&lt;/p></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/iowahurricane2020/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/iowahurricane2020/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been far too long, again, since I posted to this blog, but this time I have a legitimate excuse: we&amp;rsquo;ve been without power or internet, or much of anything, since about 11:45 AM on Monday, August 10, 2020. So we have now been more than 10.5 days without power. I&amp;rsquo;m only able to post this because of a portable generator I bought on August 12 (that was an adventure in itself) and the wireless hotspot that my phone has provided almost 24/7 ever since the storm hit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Update: Power was finally restored here at about 6:30 PM, on Thursday, August 20, 2020. Now I just have 11.5 days of things to catch up on!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="preamble">Preamble&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The preamble to this story dates back to Christmas 2019, when my daughter gave me a &amp;ldquo;Dad&amp;rsquo;s Love&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; daily calendar. There have been a couple of dates I kept because they are so accurate, like the day that says &amp;ldquo;We child-proofed the house but somehow they still got in.&amp;rdquo; 😄 Tama County has been in the grips of a moderate-to-severe drought for the past couple of months so the calendar page for August 10 looked like another &amp;ldquo;keeper&amp;rdquo;. It says:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="930-am---scurry-walk">9:30 AM - Scurry Walk&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This story begins in earnest around 9:30 AM on Monday, August 10, 2020. My &amp;ldquo;scurry&amp;rdquo; and I were just completing a quick walk around Cherry Lake where we had picked up a little trash, as we usually do. We met a couple of neighbors out for a walk and chatted briefly about the weather, and I suggested that the line of storms now in western Iowa looked like they might just hold together. Every weather system thus far in the summer had passed either just to our north, just to the south, or formed just to the east, so the neighbors just scoffed at the notion of us getting any rain. I was so sure it would rain this time that I didn&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to put a concrete block on the west-half of my hot tub cover to keep it closed in case of wind. I guess I should have used all eight blocks this time? 😕&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1145-am---the-wind">11:45 AM - The Wind&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The storms did indeed &amp;ldquo;hold together&amp;rdquo;. Oh boy, did they ever. A wall of wind hit Tama-Toledo at about 11:45 AM that morning, with literally NO warning from the US Weather Service. I had received alerts from the WeatherBug app on my iPhone, but there was no &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; word of impending doom. The rain didn&amp;rsquo;t begin until 5 or 10 minutes later, and I&amp;rsquo;m not sure any hit the ground because EVERYTHING, tree limbs, mailboxes, small animals, etc., was moving sideways. The power went out moments later. It&amp;rsquo;s still out as of this writing, a little more than 10 days since.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1155-am---get-the-cats">11:55 AM - Get the Cats!&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After hustling to the basement and realizing the house was not gone, yet, we thought we&amp;rsquo;d better go back upstairs to get some candles, more flashlights, and our three cats. Mackenzie and I managed to get two of the cats pretty easily, but the third one was stubborn and had to be &amp;ldquo;captured&amp;rdquo;. While we were doing this I glanced out the window and saw nothing but tree limbs, still sailing past the windows on a nearly horizontal trajectory.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By the time we captured the last cat I thought to myself, the wind can&amp;rsquo;t last much longer&amp;hellip;it had been blowing for at least 5 minutes straight, and I do mean STRAIGHT. I was very wrong. Thinking back, I do believe the wind blew at upwards of 100 MPH or more for at least 20 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1158-am---morgans-story">11:58 AM - Morgan&amp;rsquo;s Story&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>My daughter, Morgan, had been at the STC Middle School in Toledo working on getting her classroom ready for the start of school. She got a call from a friend in Des Moines at about 11:30 AM telling her to watch out for a line of t-storms heading her way. There are no windows in her classroom so when she finally left the Middle School and saw how dark the sky was she got really concerned and promptly ordered the building secretary to open the office and get a handful of students back inside. They had just dismissed from summer-school and were waiting outside for their parents to pick them up. Good thing she did that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Morgan drove away from the Middle School just minutes before a wall-of-wind roared in, and she called my cell phone at 11:50 AM just as she passed our house, letting me know that she was going straight to her apartment because her landlord wasn&amp;rsquo;t home and she was worried about her cats. The 5-minute drive to her apartment took about 3 hours? A couple of minutes later, at 11:55 AM we ran to our basement (after a 2nd mailbox went sailing past our front door) and Morgan called again at 11:58 AM. Her car had been hit by a falling tree limb, about 6&amp;rdquo; in diameter, near the crest of the hill on State Street in Tama, just south of the Tama Park. Her windshield was shattered, fortunately on the passenger&amp;rsquo;s side, and she was freaking out. I told her to stay in her car and Christine called 9-1-1 to provide her with some emergency aid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 9-1-1 call had to route through Benton county (30 miles east of us) as the local center was already overwhelmed, and the storm hadn&amp;rsquo;t hit there yet. A local police officer was dispatched and could get no closer than about 2.5 blocks from Morgan&amp;rsquo;s car due to downed trees, but made his way to her on-foot. He told her same as me, stay in your car to avoid downed power lines and potentially being hit by flying debris. He also told her to fasten her seatbelt in case the wind flipped the car over. Yikes! That happened at 12:18 PM, and the wind was still fierce!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At 12:20 PM my wife realized where Morgan was and called a friend who lives at the location of Morgan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;tree incident&amp;rdquo;, and that friend managed to summon her inside once it was safe to make a run for it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1230-pm---the-wind-finally-stopped-time-to-rescue-morgan">12:30 PM - The Wind Finally Stopped, Time to &amp;ldquo;Rescue&amp;rdquo; Morgan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It was about 12:30 PM when I felt like it was finally safe to go back upstairs and outside. Our mission was to try and get to Morgan as soon as possible. The power was out so I could not easily raise our double garage door, so I peeked out the front door to see what the situation was. OMG!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our house is about 70 years old and it is (was) surrounded by five very large, mature trees&amp;hellip; two grand old Oaks flanking the front yard, an American Sycamore directly west of our garage and patio, and two very tall pines on the NW and NE corners of the house, plus a few smaller and younger trees and bushes. Our driveway measures about 15&amp;rsquo; x 45&amp;rsquo; and it was entirely covered in limbs from one of the oaks and the Sycamore. Some of the limbs down on the driveway measured more than 10&amp;rdquo; in diameter. It ultimately took about 14 hours of back-breaking effort just to clear the driveway well enough for us to get both vehicles out of the garage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the immediate aftermath of the storm I had two other transportation options: the bicycle I had just purchased on Saturday, August 8; or my daughter Mackenzie&amp;rsquo;s car which was parked at the curb west of our house. I was pretty sure that car, parked partly beneath one of the oaks and the Sycamore, would be badly damaged, but it was not. There were limbs and whole trees, from our neighbor to the west, lying all around it, but the car was unscathed and operable. It took a little serpentine driving to navigate out of it&amp;rsquo;s parking spot, but by about 12:45 PM Christine and I were able to get it out and on-the road to try and &amp;ldquo;rescue&amp;rdquo; Morgan, roughly 1/2-mile away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That 1/2-mile trip featured five impassable streets and a mile or two of back-tracking to find a suitable (barely) route. The four-lane US Highway 63 proved to be the best route for most of the trip only because it was wide enough that trees on the west side generally didn&amp;rsquo;t block all four lanes. We arrived in the vicinity of Morgan&amp;rsquo;s car at 1:02 PM and found that she had already pulled the largest limb off her car, what was left looked like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;figcaption>Morgan&amp;#39;s Damaged Nissan Rogue - A Total Loss&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Morgan&amp;rsquo;s apartment is about 1-mile from the location where we left her car, and she knew that her landlord and family were away in Cedar Rapids for the day, so we headed there to check on that property, and her cats. That trip took about 10 minutes with numerous &amp;ldquo;detours&amp;rdquo; but I was able to drive to within a half-block of the house. Thankfully we found the house intact with no visible, major damage, and the cats were safe, but obviously frightened, still inside Morgan&amp;rsquo;s apartment. Fortunately, the large old tree outside Morgan&amp;rsquo;s apartment window was damaged earlier this year in a storm, and had to be taken down entirely just a couple of weeks ago; otherwise it would have certainly damaged the house and her apartment. We called the landlord to report the relatively good news as they tried to begin their journey back home from CR. Then it started to rain again, just a little.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This part of the story is perhaps best told in pictures. I took some photos and am posting them here in chronological order, with descriptive captions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The power was out everywhere for 30 to 50 miles all around us so we assumed it was safe to get outside and take some better photos. No chance of getting cars out of the garage&amp;hellip; our driveway was at least 80% covered by tree parts, some places it was 4 feet deep.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>There were three pleasantly-amazing (lucky) things that happened, or didn&amp;rsquo;t happen as the case may be, on the west, windward, side of the house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First up, my home-made lightweight teardrop camper, &amp;ldquo;The Rolling Stone&amp;rdquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s the gray thing that looks like a big old boulder on wheels in the right side of the first image below. It survived, almost unscathed! The only damage was from the door being blown open. That door hit the west wall of the house so hard that it bent a 1/8&amp;rdquo; thick steel latch plate back at a 120° angle. Because the door was open, things just inside the door also got a little wet, but they dried out well since then. The whole camper pitched forward about 3&amp;rsquo; in the wind, but the on-board drop-foot was down so it didn&amp;rsquo;t fall to the ground. Had any large limbs fallen directly on it, we&amp;rsquo;d have had a total loss of structure and contents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>Looking SE from the NW Corner of Our Property&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, the hot tub and grill. The very first thing I did when I got outdoors after the storm was to flip the hot tub cover back down. I have yet to clean all the leaves and debris out of the water&amp;hellip;maybe later today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I receive any alert of a possible storm I always move one of the concrete blocks, seen stacked on the right in the image below, over to the west edge of my hot tub cover in order to keep it from blowing open. I made that move about 15 minutes before the storm hit, but it didn&amp;rsquo;t help. In fact, it did more damage, I think. The cover seems to be OK, but the wind did flip it open, sending the concrete block sailing about 10&amp;rsquo; into the side of the house and narrowly missing the bathroom window that you can see. Lucky for us!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But our gas grill was not so lucky. That concrete block smashed down upon it leaving a big dent in the top, and causing the grill to &amp;ldquo;list&amp;rdquo; about 2&amp;rdquo; to port (the left side when looking from back to front).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, the limbs on the roof; you can see them clearly in some of these images. There were actually three of them, the largest with a diameter of about 5&amp;rdquo; at its base. All three were from the Sycamore tree, which I suppose is lucky. Sycamore&amp;rsquo;s have ENORMOUS leaves and while I feared severe damage to the roof, it looks like all three limbs just gently &amp;ldquo;floated&amp;rdquo; down to where I found them. I got them sawed up, and down off the roof, including an informal damage inspection plus wasp nest encounter, on Tuesday, August 11.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="building-the-worlds-largest--boma">Building the World&amp;rsquo;s Largest (?) Boma&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The mayors of Tama and Toledo, along with the Tama Co. Emergency Management office, called a public meeting, conducted in the parking lot of the nearby Tama-Toledo Family Aquatic Center, for 6 PM on Wednesday, August 12. At that meeting the cities informed everyone that any debris left at the curb would eventually be picked up and disposed of by a city crew. So, we started building what I like to think of as the world&amp;rsquo;s largest &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boma_(enclosure)">boma&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the images below you can see both our west and south bomas. We didn&amp;rsquo;t need any on the east or north since we have neighbors on those sides, but we did build a small boma (about 30&amp;rsquo; long by 10&amp;rsquo; wide) in the parking lot of the church that sits at the NE corner of our property, where our utilities pole is located.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On Thursday, August 13, I started to address some of the potential widow-makers still hanging in our trees. My first target was the one shown below. I managed to rig a short chain to the end of a nylon rope and after about 10 tries I got the chain wrapped around the most menacing widow-maker, and yanked that sucker right out of the tree. They call me the &amp;ldquo;Tree Wrangler&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to report that subsequent limb-roping adventures took fewer tosses!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Do you remember seeing an ominous widow-maker in the Sycamore tree in earlier images? Well she is no more. At about 1:30 PM on Wednesday, August 19, I roped that critter and managed, with considerable effort, to yank that bad boy down. Proof that &amp;ldquo;The Tree Wrangler&amp;rdquo; has struck again&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

They were being sold on a first-come basis, right off the truck, so Morgan and I got in the van and headed to Waterloo as fast as possible&amp;hellip;we got one at Lowe&amp;rsquo;s for $800. Had to wait in line for a couple of hours too, but managed to get home mid-afternoon with the generator, some ice and gasoline. None of those things would be available locally until Friday, August 14.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>My biggest remaining worry is the pine tree at the NW corner of the house. On Thursday, August 13, during clean-up I discovered that the bark on the SE side of the tree is &amp;ldquo;crushed&amp;rdquo; as you can see in the image below, and there&amp;rsquo;s a visible &amp;ldquo;crack&amp;rdquo; on the NW side of the tree right at ground-level. Upon closer inspection it looks like the tree is leaning about 5°, naturally right toward our house. 😟&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One block west of our house there&amp;rsquo;s a bank, and it used to have a large golden-colored eagle atop it&amp;rsquo;s electronic sign at the intersection of Summit Street and US Highway 63. When we told folks from out-of-town how to find us we would always use that eagle as a navigational aid, telling them to find the eagle and head one block east to our house.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, our navigational aid got its wings during the storm. As you can see in the photos below, the eagle &amp;ldquo;flew&amp;rdquo; about 200 feet and landed in the bank&amp;rsquo;s lawn.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="oak-hill-cemetery---august-20-2020">Oak Hill Cemetery - August 20, 2020&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Since all the Alliant trucks rolled past our house around 10 AM this morning, I thought it was time to visit Ian and my parents at Oak Hill Cemetery. Frustrations at home certainly weren&amp;rsquo;t getting any better so I felt like getting away to take a deep breath and realign my perspective a little. Oak Hill usually does that for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oak Hill Cemetery is well-named&amp;hellip;it blankets the hill with Ian and my parents&amp;rsquo; graves near the very top, and there are lots of oaks, but even more pines. Well, there used to be anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is perhaps another case where photos tell the story better than I. However, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the few photos I took will reflect the scale of the devastation. For starters, the main road up to the cemetery is still blocked, as are the three entrances into the original cemetery. Fortunately, the newest section where there are no mature trees, was relatively clear. So, Morgan and I were able to drive in and park about 100 yards from the hilltop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a glimpse of what we found there&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>The Big Pine Near the McFate Plots&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The broken pine, shown above, is, or was, near my parents&amp;rsquo; graves, and you can see their shared headstone just to the right in the image above. My son, Ian, is buried a little to the left of the edge of the image, but you can&amp;rsquo;t see that grave from this angle because of all the tree debris. &lt;a href="https://coord.info/GC4BG3B">&amp;ldquo;Ian&amp;rsquo;s Cache&amp;rdquo;, GC4BG3B&lt;/a> is somewhere inside or under that tree. I looked for the container for about 15 minutes this morning, but came up empty-handed. 😦&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, when the ol&amp;rsquo; tree fell it missed Ian&amp;rsquo;s grave by a few feet. We got lucky and found all four of the clear acrylic cylinders that used to adorn his grave. They are all intact, but need a little TLC before we put them all back out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My parents&amp;rsquo; headstone is in good shape, but another tree toppled the nearby stone marker for my aunt, Dorothy Paddleford. I&amp;rsquo;ll see to it that gets fixed soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few weeks ago my brother-in-law, Dennis, set in-motion a plan to install an engraved stone bench as a memorial for my sister, Marlene McFate Burkheimer. It was to be placed not far from the cemetery road at the very top of the hill, about 50&amp;rsquo; from the big pine. At one time we thought about looking into wrapping a bench around that ol&amp;rsquo; pine to provide a nice place, in the shade, to sit and relax. However, providing a concrete base for such a bench would have been very difficult. Maybe if the pine&amp;rsquo;s stump is removed we can place the bench where the tree was, and maybe one day plant another tree to provide the shady spot we hoped for?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tomorrow morning I plan to contact the City of Tama and the Oak Hill Cemetery Association to see about volunteering to help with clean-up. I think they are going to want all the help they can get in the coming weeks and months.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gnight">G&amp;rsquo;night&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s late-evening again, but at least now I have some real lights to work by. Tomorrow I need to start reprogramming all the devices that have been dead for 11.5 days, and begin making up for as many days of missed work. Time for bed. G&amp;rsquo;night all.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Until next time&amp;hellip; but I hope there&amp;rsquo;s never another &amp;ldquo;next time&amp;rdquo; quite like this one!&lt;/p></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/trash-walks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/trash-walks/</guid><description>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s been far too long since I posted to this blog; I guess I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy? Nah, not any more than usual, but during the COVID-19 pandemic I have doubled my efforts to get out and walk in the fresh air whenever possible. I&amp;rsquo;m thankful for my small &amp;ldquo;scurry&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s the term for a collective of squirrels &amp;ndash; who not only take walks with me around Cherry Lake, but all around town.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>About three months ago there was some vandalism at Cherry Lake, and there was a time when folks were leaving lots of trash around the lake. So our scurry started carrying &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://ungerconsumer.com/product/36-nifty-nabber/">Niffty Nabbers&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo; and now we clean up what we can as we walk. We have even extended the practice beyond the lake, and we generally walk twice a day now, most evenings somewhere in Tama or Toledo away from all the mosquitoes that inhabit Cherry Lake. True to form, we pick up trash as we go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would estimate that both solo and with my scurry, I/we have picked up about 100 pounds of trash so far.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This past weekend I was thinking&amp;hellip; now that we have expaned to more than just Cherry Lake, it would be nice to plot our routes walked somewhere online so that we can keep track of progress, and see where we haven&amp;rsquo;t been yet. Fortunately, I tend to activate a &amp;ldquo;workout&amp;rdquo; recording on my Apple Watch whenever we go out, and I just realized that those routes can be exported from my iPhone as .gpx files. So, one day soon I hope to create a new section in this blog where I can post records, with maps, of our excursions. Look for it in this blog soon, or at least sooner or later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a wrap. Until next time&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/microposts/endoscopy/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/microposts/endoscopy/</guid><description>&lt;p>Been sitting in the endoscopy waiting room at MercyOne DSM since 10:50 AM and they haven&amp;rsquo;t even called Chris in to prep her yet. 😦 Gonna be a very long day.&lt;/p></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/onetabs/home-automation-01/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 10:40:08 -0500</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/onetabs/home-automation-01/</guid><description/></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/home-automation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/home-automation/</guid><description>&lt;p>During the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a> I decided, while working endlessly from my home office, to resurect the hanging bird feeder outside my office window. I like having the birds visit, but I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed one problem&amp;hellip; starlings! They are cranky, bully bastards and chase all the welcome visitors away, if I let them. Well, I don&amp;rsquo;t intend to let them anymore. 😁 I won&amp;rsquo;t go into details here but my remedy involves removing the screen from my office window, and occasionally opening the window itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two issues with the window&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s a big, double casement window with a pair of crank mechanisms for opening, and the one that I need to open most often is situated behind my mini-fridge. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to get to the opener crank, and even hard to open or close it &amp;ldquo;gently&amp;rdquo;. The other issue is that while the window is open my office door needs to be closed so that our house cats won&amp;rsquo;t wander in and decide to &amp;ldquo;escape&amp;rdquo; through the open window. 😾 I suppose the cats could provide some extra starling deternt, but they are not as selective as I am. If it moves, they want to catch it. 🐈&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The solution, I hope, is to build and install an automated window opener, one that I can control without getting out of my seat. It would also be nice if I had the same option to open, or at least close, my office door. I have a spare &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi">Raspberry Pi Zero W&lt;/a> and some related parts so that&amp;rsquo;s a start. I&amp;rsquo;ve also just purchased a little &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07252J5GV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">High-Torque DC Motor&lt;/a> and a RPI-compatible &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQ2MZDV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1">motor controller&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

The package is &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/remote-atom">Remote Atom&lt;/a> and I found the configuration to be a little confusing, but in the end it was worth the work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="use">Use&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The addition and configuration of this package allows me to open an &lt;em>SSH&lt;/em> terminal/session from my Mac Mini to my &lt;em>summitt-dweller-DO-docker&lt;/em> droplet and, with &lt;em>Atom&lt;/em> open locally on my Mac I can issue a command like&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ratom /opt/README.md
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>in the terminal connected to &lt;em>summitt-dweller-DO-docker&lt;/em>, and the specified &amp;ldquo;remote&amp;rdquo; file will open in my local &lt;em>Atom&lt;/em>. Better still, if I make changes to the file and save them, the remote copy is automatically updated as saved.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="configuration">Configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As I said, configuration was a little dicey. Mine followed exactly what&amp;rsquo;s documented in &lt;a href="https://atom.io/packages/remote-atom">the project site&lt;/a>, complete with renaming &lt;code>rmate&lt;/code> to &lt;code>ratom&lt;/code> as suggested. The real key to configuration has two parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>First, &lt;em>Atom&lt;/em> has to be open locally. This is necessary to get the package running so that it can accept connections from the remote, and that also requires that the package is auto-started along with &lt;em>Atom&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Next, I added the following specs to &lt;code>~/.ssh/config&lt;/code> on my Mac Mini:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Host 104.248.237.235
RemoteForward 52698 localhost:52698
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That addition to &lt;code>~/.ssh/config&lt;/code> allows me to run my usual &lt;em>ssh&lt;/em> connection commands without having to specify any remote/reverse tunneling&amp;hellip;the config does it for me automatically when the &amp;ldquo;Host&amp;rdquo; or target is &lt;em>summitt-dweller-DO-docker&lt;/em>. Without that spec I&amp;rsquo;d have to configure each &lt;em>ssh&lt;/em> connection I open, like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ssh -R 52698:localhost:52698 administrator@104.248.237.235
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a wrap.

This is espeically true of things like &amp;ldquo;README.md&amp;rdquo; documents that I intend to read, but not edit. This can be done without any special configuration, assuming &lt;em>MacDown&lt;/em> is installed and working. To do that use a syntax like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>open -b com.uranusjr.macdown path/to/document.md
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>A command I&amp;rsquo;ve been using quite often today is: &lt;code>open -b com.uranusjr.macdown ~/GitHub/dg-isle/docs/install/install-local-migrate.md&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Sorry for my extended absence here, I&amp;rsquo;ve been uber-busy with work, but have also been able to work a little (lots of long nights and weekends) on a long-overdue update of &lt;a href="https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com">https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com&lt;/a> in &lt;em>Drupal 8&lt;/em>. It&amp;rsquo;s true, I have been thinking about moving that site to make it static, almost certainly using &lt;em>Hugo&lt;/em>, but I thought before doing so I&amp;rsquo;d give &lt;em>Drupal 8&lt;/em> one more try. I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to report that it&amp;rsquo;s working nicely again. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it, and how I plan to keep it updated&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="saved-by-docker-compose-drupal">Saved by &amp;ldquo;docker-compose-drupal&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I actually started the process of migrating and updating &lt;a href="https://wieting.tamatoledo.com">the Wieting website&lt;/a> in &lt;em>Docksal&lt;/em>, but I failed&amp;hellip; I could never figure out how to reliably and easily push my work to production from there. &lt;em>Docksal&lt;/em> just seems to wrap so much of itself into the &lt;code>cli&lt;/code> container that drives it, I found it difficult to de-couple from that in production.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I went looking elsewhere and discovered &lt;a href="https://devwithlando.org">Lando&lt;/a>, and I did considerable work with it because &lt;em>Lando&lt;/em>, at least in the case of &lt;em>Drupal&lt;/em>, builds a 3-part development stack that looks a lot like what I wanted to deploy in production. The parts of a &lt;em>Lando&lt;/em> stack, and my production stack, are the same:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An &lt;code>nginx&lt;/code> web server container,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;code>mysql&lt;/code> or &lt;code>mariadb&lt;/code> database container, and&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;code>php&lt;/code> codebase container.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>But once again I had trouble figuring out exactly how to push that development stack to production. So, I went looking again for an open (and by that I mean &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; and freely modifiable) production-ready stack configuration that uses the 3-parts I had in mind. I found &lt;a href="https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal">docker-compose-drupal&lt;/a> and almost immediately created &lt;a href="https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal">my own fork&lt;/a> of that project. Using &lt;a href="https://github.com/SummittDweller/docker-compose-drupal">my &lt;code>docker-compose-drupal&lt;/code> fork&lt;/a> I set off to build a production instance, NOT a development instance, on my &lt;code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker&lt;/code> droplet at &lt;em>DigitalOcean&lt;/em>. That project came to life in &lt;code>/opt/docker-compose-drupal&lt;/code> there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The evolution of &lt;code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker:/opt/docker-compose-drupal&lt;/code> was quite an adventure, in large part because the &lt;em>Wieting&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em> web site had gone almost a year without any updates. That meant upgrading the &lt;em>Drupal&lt;/em> core from version 8.2.? to version 8.8.2, along with countless modules that had changed rather dramatically, so there were lots of bumps along the way. I also had to move the site from a multi-site configuration, the old site lived in a container at &lt;code>/var/www/html/web/sites/wieting&lt;/code>, to a &lt;em>default&lt;/em> configuration that lives in the container at &lt;code>/var/www/localhost/web/sites/default&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal">docker-compose-drupal&lt;/a> includes some nice scripts and features to help with things like that, and they are nicely documented in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/mogtofu33/docker-compose-drupal/blob/master/README.md">project&amp;rsquo;s README.md&lt;/a> file. I&amp;rsquo;ll elaborate on a few of the key features later in this post, but most of what I did during the migration and update is water-under-the-bridge, and should not need to be repeated, ever, so I won&amp;rsquo;t elaborate on all of it here. It&amp;rsquo;s worth noting here that the work I did in my fork all happened in a branch named &lt;code>wieting&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="moved-to-wieting-d8-do">Moved to &amp;ldquo;wieting-D8-DO&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once I had a new site working as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped, I wanted to begin a fresh new development and update cycle, so I used a process I&amp;rsquo;ve documented in my work blog: &lt;a href="https://static.grinnell.edu/blogs/McFateM/posts/065-create-new-github-project-from-a-branch/">&amp;ldquo;How to Create a New GitHub Repo from an Existing Branch&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. That work created the &lt;em>Wieting&lt;/em> site&amp;rsquo;s new home, &lt;a href="https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO">https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO&lt;/a>, based on the &lt;em>wieting&lt;/em> branch of the aforementioned fork of &lt;em>docker-compose-drupal&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="site-update-workflow">Site Update Workflow&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Having built the &lt;a href="https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO">wieting-D8-DO&lt;/a> project I need a reliable workflow that I could use to keep it up-to-date. I created that workflow by migrating the existing production site at &lt;code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker:/opt/docker-compose-drupal&lt;/code>, where it responded as &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://Wieting.TamaToledo.org">https://Wieting.TamaToledo.org&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, to a new staging copy at &lt;code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker:/opt/wieting-D8-DO&lt;/code>, where it would respond, temporarily, at my designated &amp;ldquo;staging&amp;rdquo; address, &lt;em>&lt;a href="https://Wieting.SummittServices.com">https://Wieting.SummittServices.com&lt;/a>&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While working as &lt;em>administrator&lt;/em> on &lt;code>summitt-dweller-DO-docker&lt;/code> the entire command-line process looked like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>echo $(date --iso-8601)
cd /opt/docker-compose-drupal
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard &amp;gt; $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list
tar czvf $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list.tar.gz --files-from $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list
gpg --encrypt --recipient summitt.dweller@gmail.com $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list.tar.gz
rm -fr $(date --iso-8601).ignored.list.tar.gz
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/wieting-D8-DO.git
cd wieting-D8-DO
cp -f ../docker-compose-drupal/2020-02-27.ignored.list.tar.gz.gpg .
gpg --decrypt 2020-02-27.ignored.list.tar.gz.gpg &amp;gt; ignored.tar.gz
tar xzvf ignored.tar.gz

mv -f database/dump/dump.sql /opt/wieting-D8-DO/database/mysql-init
cd /opt/wieting-D8-DO

docker-compose up -d
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;h3 id="breaking-the-workflow-down">Breaking the Workflow Down&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Moving the site from &lt;code>/opt/docker-compose-drupal&lt;/code> and &lt;a href="https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com">https://Wieting.TamaToledo.com&lt;/a>, to &lt;code>/opt/wieting-D8-DO&lt;/code> and &lt;a href="https://Wieting.SummittServices.com">https://Wieting.SummittServices.com&lt;/a> is a command-line process like this, with comments&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This post is really part of my &lt;a href="http://weblog-sd.docksal/photos/norway-june-2019/norway-june-2019/">Norway photo blog&lt;/a> which you can find elsewhere on this site. Note that the photos here are in reverse-chronological order with the exception of one &amp;ldquo;lead&amp;rdquo; post that lays out our itinerary. So, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I drove the 5 of us, plus luggage, in our mini-van to Minneapolis for our departure, and we left home early just in case there were surprises. Good thing we did! I drove US 20 to I35 with a stop in Storm Lake for a late lunch. Not long after that stop we hit the first snag and found I35 closed, in both directions, just south of the Iowa-Minnesota border. The stop and detour there set us back about a half hour or so&amp;hellip;no problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We booked and found off-site parking near the airport in Minneapolis, and got dropped off at the correct terminal for &lt;em>Iceland Air&lt;/em>, which will forever be known in this household as &lt;code>Iceland Error&lt;/code>. That&amp;rsquo;s when things really go interesting. &lt;code>Iceland Error&lt;/code> had changed our flight, and itinerary, without notice (they have no mobile app). We would be leaving the US about an hour later, good thing, and arriving in Kirkenes about 16 hours ahead of our original schedule! We weren&amp;rsquo;t even booked on &lt;code>Iceland Error&lt;/code> for our departure, instead we were flying &lt;em>Air France&lt;/em> to Paris, then to Oslo, and connecting directly to Kirkenes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The change meant we had to change terminals, back to the terminal we&amp;rsquo;d just come from with luggage in tow. Not fun.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ok, so &lt;em>Air France&lt;/em> was GREAT! They fed us, we had comfortable seats, they dimmed the lights, had nice entertainment, and provided whatever we needed at no extra charge. For the record, &lt;code>Iceland Error&lt;/code> did NONE of that on our return to the U.S.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I digress&amp;hellip; We got to Paris without a hitch and in good spirits, found our connecting flight to Oslo and made that leg in good shape. Then on to Kirkenes rather than staying a night in Oslo, and that was OK, except that Kirkenes isn&amp;rsquo;t a big city, and when we arrived ahead of schedule there was no shuttle waiting for us (the one that did arrive was full), but the good folks there dispatched one especially for us.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We arrived at our hotel around 11 PM local time, I think. Of course, it was difficult to tell the time because the sun was still up, and would remain &amp;ldquo;up&amp;rdquo; for pretty much the next 4 days!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The hotel had only one spare room for the night, so Chris and I took that one, and they arranged for Mark, Deb and Doug to taxi about 30 minutes outside of town to a &amp;ldquo;cabin&amp;rdquo; near the Russian border. Lucky for them&amp;hellip;they got to set foot, or at least a big toe, in Russia, at about 2 AM, I think. Silly Americans. 😁&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To be honest, I loved the &amp;ldquo;midnight sun&amp;rdquo;, it was great for geocaching, but really put a dent in my already damaged sleep schedule. 😉&lt;/p></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/photos/norway-june-2019/norway-june-2019/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/photos/norway-june-2019/norway-june-2019/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>From June 11th through the 23rd, we (that&amp;rsquo;s me, Chris, her brother Mark, sister Deb, and Deb&amp;rsquo;s husband, Doug) traveled to Norway. Our rough itinerary was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday/Wednesday, June 11-12 - Travel: Flew Minneapolis to Paris, to Oslo, to Kirkenes, Norway. A very long day!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday, June 13 - Kirkenes: Land of the midnight sun, with a side-trip into Finland.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday, June 14 - Kirkenes: Boarded the MS Finnmarken for a 5-day cruise to Bergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday, June 15 - MS Finnmarken: With a breakfast excursion to Nord Capp (North Cape).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunday, June 16 - MS Finnmarken:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monday, June 17 - MS Finnmarken:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tuesday, June 18 - MS Finnmarken: With a dinner excursion on The Atlantic Road.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday, June 19 - Bergen: Strolled through the port, fish market, and Edvard Grieg Square.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday, June 20 - Nesflaten: Drove our rental to Nesflaten with a stop in Røldal, then a stroll around town with our host, Magne.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday, June 21 - Nesflaten: Visited the Jordebrek and Olsen farms, drove to Sand and back, for a family dinner in the evening.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday, June 22 - Oslo: Drove across Telemark, through Nottoden, to Oslo for our departure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunday, June 23 - Travel: Flew Oslo to Bergen, to Reykjavik, to Minneapolis.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/photos/norway-june-2019/june-23/june-23/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/photos/norway-june-2019/june-23/june-23/</guid><description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->

&lt;p>The midnight sun really messed with me on this vacation. We arrived in Kirkenes at about 8 PM local time, and the sun was still high in the sky.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I drove the 5 of us, plus luggage, in our mini-van to Minneapolis for our departure, and we left home early just in case there were surprises. Good thing we did! I drove US 20 to I35 with a stop in Storm Lake for a late lunch. Not long after that stop we hit the first snag and found I35 closed, in both directions, just south of the Iowa-Minnesota border. The stop and detour there set us back about a half hour or so&amp;hellip;no problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We booked and found off-site parking near the airport in Minneapolis, and got dropped off at the correct terminal for &lt;em>Iceland Air&lt;/em>, which will forever be known in this household as &lt;strong>Iceland Error&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/microposts/norway-june-2019/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>Mark McFate</author><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/microposts/norway-june-2019/</guid><description>&lt;p>From June 11th through the 23rd, we (that&amp;rsquo;s me, Chris, her brother Mark, sister Deb, and Deb&amp;rsquo;s husband, Doug) traveled to Norway. Our rough itinerary was:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Tuesday/Wednesday, June 11-12 - Travel: Flew Minneapolis to Paris, to Oslo, to Kirkenes, Norway. A very long day!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday, June 13 - Kirkenes: Land of the midnight sun, with a side-trip into Finland.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday, June 14 - Kirkenes: Boarded the MS Finnmarken for a 5-day cruise to Bergen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday, June 15 - MS Finnmarken: With a breakfast excursion to Nord Capp (North Cape).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunday, June 16 - MS Finnmarken:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monday, June 17 - MS Finnmarken:&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tuesday, June 18 - MS Finnmarken: With a dinner excursion on The Atlantic Road.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wednesday, June 19 - Bergen: Strolled through the port, fish market, and Edvard Grieg Square.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Thursday, June 20 - Nesflaten: Drove our rental to Nesflaten with a stop in Røldal, then a stroll around town with our host, Magne.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Friday, June 21 - Nesflaten: Visited the Jordebrek and Olsen farms, drove to Sand and back, for a family dinner in the evening.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Saturday, June 22 - Oslo: Drove across Telemark, through Nottoden, to Oslo for our departure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sunday, June 23 - Travel: Flew Oslo to Bergen, to Reykjavik, to Minneapolis.&lt;/li>

I find that the Apple Photos app does a pretty nice job of cataloging photos and videos into &lt;code>Moments&lt;/code>. Each &lt;code>Moment&lt;/code> includes all the images taken in a single day, and sometimes in a particular location, if photos are taken on the same day, but a great distance apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moment names from my Norway vacation were nicely descriptive, like:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport - Minneapolis, MN, June 11, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport - Mauregard, Île-de-France, June 12, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Jessheim - Akershus, June 12, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kirkenes, Finnmark - Johan Knudtzens gate, June 12, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kirkenes, Finnmark - Dr. Wessels gate, June 13, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Kirkenes, Finnmark - Johan Knudtzens gate, June 14, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Skarsvåg - Finnmark, June 14, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Arnøyhamn - Norway, June 15, 2019&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="exporting-the-photos">Exporting the Photos&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I found &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/photos/export-photos-videos-and-slideshows-pht6e157c5f/mac">this resource&lt;/a> on the web and followed it for the export portion of my process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I opened &lt;code>Photos&lt;/code> on my Mac Mini, selected the &lt;code>Moments&lt;/code> view/tab, culled some of the duplicates out, then selected all 359 remaining images using my mouse. With the images highlighted I selected menu options: &lt;code>File&lt;/code>, &lt;code>Export&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>Export 359 Photos...&lt;/code>. I subsequently filled in the following dialog like so:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;figure>
&lt;img src="https://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png" alt="Photos Export Dialog">
&lt;figcaption>&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I choose a &amp;lsquo;Photo Kind&amp;rsquo;, or format, equal to &lt;code>PNG&lt;/code> and a &amp;lsquo;Size&amp;rsquo; equal to &lt;code>Medium&lt;/code>, since most of the images are huge and would load very slowly in my blog if left at their original size. I elected to save the exported PNG images into a new folder on my &lt;code>~/Desktop&lt;/code> named &lt;code>Norway-Medium-PNG-Export&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="upload-to-digital-ocean-spaces">Upload to Digital Ocean &amp;ldquo;Spaces&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A few days ago I registered with &lt;em>Digital Ocean&lt;/em> &lt;a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces?i=d7d6c7">&amp;ldquo;Spaces&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>, and created my first &amp;ldquo;bucket&amp;rdquo; named &lt;code>images-summittdweller&lt;/code>. &lt;em>Spaces&lt;/em> provides me with up to 280 GB of REST-accessible object storage for a small monthly fee. To host my photos there I simply created a &amp;ldquo;folder&amp;rdquo; named &lt;a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/spaces/images-summittdweller?i=d7d6c7&amp;amp;path=Norway-Photos-2019%2F">Norway-Photos-2019&lt;/a> and did a drag-n-drop of each &lt;code>~/Desktop/Norway-Medium-PNG-Export/&lt;/code> individual* folder directly into my browser window. *Note that the drag-n-drop interface was unable to swallow the entire &lt;code>Norway-Medium-PNG-Export&lt;/code> folder all at once. 😞&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of my uploads to the &lt;code>images-summittdweller&lt;/code> bucket were declared as &lt;code>Public&lt;/code> rather than &lt;code>Private&lt;/code>, that way they can be accessed using simple URLs without authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="additional-images">Additional Images&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to the aforementioned photos, I also parked a copy of the &lt;code>PhotosExportDialog.png&lt;/code> screen capture there in the root folder. It&amp;rsquo;s accessible as &lt;a href="https://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png">https://images.summittdweller.com/Norway-Photos-2019/PhotosExportDialog.png&lt;/a> and that&amp;rsquo;s what I used above to embed the image you see in this document.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the future, more images, perhaps some taken by Deb, Doug, or Mark McCune, can be added to this photo blog in a similar manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="object-structure-and-urls">Object Structure and URLs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A sampling of the bucket/object/filenames and URLs from &lt;code>images-summittdweller&lt;/code> are tabulated below. From this small sample the URL structure is easy to infer.&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
