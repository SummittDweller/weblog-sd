The package is Remote Atom and I found the configuration to be a little confusing, but in the end it was worth the work.
Use The addition and configuration of this package allows me to open an SSH terminal/session from my Mac Mini to my summitt-dweller-DO-docker droplet and, with Atom open locally on my Mac I can issue a command like</description></item><item><title>Launching MacDown from a Terminal</title><link>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/launching-macdown-from-a-terminal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://summittdweller.com/blogs/mark/posts/launching-macdown-from-a-terminal/</guid><description>Lately I find that I like to open Markdown documents in MacDown rather than Atom.

This can be done without any special configuration, assuming MacDown is installed and working. To do that use a syntax like this:
