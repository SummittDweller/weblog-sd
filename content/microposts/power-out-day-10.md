The power is still out here, almost 10 days after the derecho knocked it out. So many power restoration predictions have come and gone, I've lost count. Still I'm told that what we need is a one-man, 15-minute fix. Perhaps in the morning I'll stretch our broken power line across the street and pitch a tent next door until an Alliant truck stops and gets this done. I know they are busy, but 15 minutes of one lineman's time a week ago, when it was first "promised", would have been so nice. I fixed my own Mediacom connection more than a week ago, and there's evidence tonight that their service has been restored.  So, if I had power, I think we would also have TV and internet.  IF.
