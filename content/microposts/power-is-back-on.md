Eleven days and seven hours without, but the power is now back on at 104 W. Summit Street in Toledo. I'd estimate that for the duration we burned about 105 gallons of gas just to keep the fridge, my CPAP, one lamp, and two fans running.  Glad to be back in the 21st century. Now, what's all this I hear about a deadly virus and some political scuffles?
